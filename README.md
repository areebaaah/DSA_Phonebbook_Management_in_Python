# DSA_Phonebbook_Management_in_Python

The functional phone book application is designed to manage contact information efficiently. The script implementing this project employs a procedural programming approach, using modular functions to perform key operations such as
adding, displaying, modifying, searching, and deleting contacts. Utilizing CSV
files for data storage ensures persistence across sessions, and the script offers a
command-line interface for user interaction. The code is both a practical tool
for organizing contacts and an educational resource for learning Python, file
handling, and basic data structures.
